Here's what I've added to make the hero section more engaging:

1. Imported `motion` from Framer Motion to create animated components.
2. Wrapped the text elements (h1, h2, p, and the social icons container) with `motion` components.
3. Added fade-in and slide-up animations to these elements with staggered delays for a sequential reveal effect.
4. Created two animated background blobs using `motion.div` elements. These blobs have a scaling and rotation animation that repeats infinitely.
5. Added `overflow-hidden` to the main container to ensure the animated blobs don't cause unwanted scrollbars.
6. Added `aria-label` attributes to the social media links for improved accessibility.

These animations will create a more dynamic and engaging hero section:

1. The text elements will fade in and slide up sequentially.
2. Two colorful, blurred "blob" shapes in the background will slowly animate, creating a subtle, dynamic backdrop.
3. The social media icons still have their hover effect for interactivity.
